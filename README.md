<p>I've been working at <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk" target="blank">The National Archives</a> for 4 years as an apprentice back-end developer, mainly using Python<img height="15" alt="Python icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183423507-c056a6f9-1ba8-4312-a350-19bcbc5a8697.png"> frameworks such as Flask<img height="15" alt="Flask icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25181517/183423775-2276e25d-d43d-4e58-890b-edbc88e915f7.png">, Django<img height="15" alt="Django icon" src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/django.svg">, and Wagtail<img height="15" alt="Wagtail icon" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23708009?s=280&v=4">. My main project at TNA has been <a href="https://beta.nationalarchives.gov.uk/">ETNA</a> - a re-work of our current site (<a href="https://github.com/nationalarchives/ds-wagtail">See the code here!</a>) This project has allowed me to hone Python/Wagtail skills, and practice some of my front-end skills where needed.</p>

<p>I have an "accessibility-first" approach to development, striving to ensure our products are accessible to as many people as possible - regardless of their access needs.</p>

<p>I have used many different technologies and been involved in all stages of the SDLC. I thoroughly enjoy learning new things, exploring new pathways and expanding my knowledge in the digital space. This has enabled me to pick up a strong knowledge of Python (Wagtail and Flask), Git, SQL, front-end technologies (HTML, CSS/SASS, JS), and have worked on/managed sites on hosting platforms such as Platform.sh, Dreamhost and AWS.</p>
